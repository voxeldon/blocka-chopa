## For Creators
The structure of the addon was designed to work with vanilla parity in mind and so compatibility requires use of standard formatting.

`This simply means Blocks & items will require tags to function correctly.`
```json
//Axe item
"components": { "tag:minecraft:is_axe": {}}
```
`The script is additionally searching for the key is_axe so you can swap minecraft out for your own identifier or simple use is_axe, this method is applicable to the following examples.`


```json
//Axe item
"components": { "tag:is_axe": {}}
```
```json
//Pickaxe item
"components": { "tag:is_pickaxe": {}}
```
```json
//Shear item
"components": { "tag:is_shear": {}}
```
```json
//Hoe item
"components": { "tag:is_hoe": {}}
```
```json
//Seed item
"components": { "tag:is_seed": {}} // this tag is optional the script additionally checks for files ending with _seed
```
```json
//Log Block
"components": { "tag:is_log": {}} // this tag is optional the script additionally checks for files ending with _log
```
```json
//Log Block
"components": { "tag:is_leaf": {}} // this tag is optional the script additionally checks for files ending with _leaves
```
```json
//Log Block
"components": { "tag:is_ore": {}} // this tag is optional the script additionally checks for files ending with _ore
```
